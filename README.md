Project developed using Spring Boot version **2.7.15** and Java **1.8**

The main focus of this project is to identify and record when a mobile station is within the communication radius of one or more base stations. 

[The Haversine formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula) was used to perform this calculation.

After uploading the service, you can access the [Swagger](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html) to perform some manual tests.
